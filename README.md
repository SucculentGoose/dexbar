# DexBar

A native macOS menu bar app that displays real-time blood glucose readings from your Dexcom CGM via the Dexcom Share API.

## Features

- **Live readings** — displays your current blood sugar value and trend arrow in the menu bar (e.g. `94 →`)
- **Auto-refresh** — polls Dexcom every 5 minutes, timed to the actual reading timestamp so refreshes stay aligned even after manual refreshes
- **mg/dL or mmol/L** — toggle units in Settings
- **Configurable alerts** — macOS notifications for:
  - High blood sugar (above a threshold you set)
  - Low blood sugar (below a threshold you set)
  - Rising fast (↑ ⇈)
  - Dropping fast (↓ ⇊)
- **Alert cooldowns** — same-type alerts won't repeat within 15 minutes
- **Secure credential storage** — username and password stored in macOS Keychain
- **Auto-connect on launch** — reconnects automatically using saved credentials
- **Region support** — US, Outside US, and Japan Dexcom Share endpoints

## Requirements

- macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- A Dexcom account with [Share enabled](https://provider.dexcom.com/education-research/cgm-education-use/videos/setting-dexcom-share-and-follow) and at least one follower set up
- Xcode 15+ (to build from source)

## Getting Started

### Download (easiest)

**One-line install** — paste this in Terminal. No quarantine warnings, no Gatekeeper prompts:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SucculentGoose/dexbar/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script downloads the latest release directly via `curl` (bypassing macOS quarantine), installs to `/Applications`, and launches the app.

<details>
<summary>Manual install instead</summary>

1. Go to the [Releases](../../releases) page and download the latest `DexBar-vX.X.X.zip`
2. Unzip and drag **DexBar.app** to your `/Applications` folder
3. **Bypass Gatekeeper:** Because DexBar is not notarized, macOS will show a *"damaged and can't be opened"* warning. Run this once in Terminal:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/DexBar.app
   ```
4. Open DexBar from `/Applications` normally

</details>

### Build from source

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dexbar.git
   cd dexbar
   ```

2. Generate the Xcode project (requires [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)):
   ```bash
   brew install xcodegen
   xcodegen generate
   ```

3. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open DexBar.xcodeproj
   ```

4. Select your Team under **Signing & Capabilities**, then build and run (`⌘R`).

### First-time setup

1. Click the `〜` icon in your menu bar
2. Click **Settings…**
3. Enter your Dexcom username, password, and region
4. Click **Connect**

Your credentials are saved to the macOS Keychain. From this point on, DexBar will connect automatically every time it launches.

## Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Username / Password | Your Dexcom Share account credentials |
| Region | US / Outside US / Japan |
| Units | mg/dL or mmol/L |
| Refresh interval | 1, 2, 5, 10, or 15 minutes |
| High alert threshold | Notify when BG exceeds this value |
| Low alert threshold | Notify when BG falls below this value |
| Rising fast alert | Notify on SingleUp or DoubleUp trend |
| Dropping fast alert | Notify on SingleDown or DoubleDown trend |

## How it works

DexBar uses the **Dexcom Share API** — the same service used by Dexcom's follower app. It requires your (or the patient's) Dexcom credentials, not a follower's credentials.

API endpoints used:
- `POST /General/AuthenticatePublisherAccount` — authenticates and returns an account ID
- `POST /General/LoginPublisherAccountById` — exchanges account ID + password for a session token
- `GET /Publisher/ReadPublisherLatestGlucoseValues` — fetches the latest glucose reading

> **Note:** Dexcom Stelo is not compatible with the Share service and is not supported.

## Linux

DexBar also runs on Linux as a system tray application. It is tested on **KDE Plasma 6** but works on any desktop environment that supports the StatusNotifierItem protocol (GNOME with AppIndicator extension, XFCE, etc.).

### Linux Requirements

- Swift 6.0+ — [swift.org/download](https://swift.org/download)
- GTK3: `libgtk-3-dev`
- System tray: `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`
- Credential storage: `libsecret-1-dev`
- Desktop notifications: `libnotify-dev`

### Linux Installation

```bash
# 1. Install system dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu/KDE Neon)
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev libsecret-1-dev libnotify-dev

# 2. Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/SucculentGoose/dexbar
cd dexbar
swift build -c release --target DexBarLinux

# 3. Install
sudo install -m 755 .build/release/DexBarLinux /usr/local/bin/dexbar
```

Or use the install script which does all of the above:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SucculentGoose/dexbar/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Linux First Run

```bash
dexbar &
```

A tray icon (`…` or `---`) appears in your system tray. Left-click to open the status popup; right-click for the menu. Open **Settings** → **Account**, enter your Dexcom credentials, choose your region, and click **Connect**.

Credentials are stored securely in KDE Wallet (or GNOME Keyring) via the Secret Service D-Bus API. On first run KDE Wallet may prompt you to create a wallet or unlock an existing one.

### Linux Known Limitations

- The interactive glucose chart is not available in the Linux version (planned for a future release).
- Automatic updates are not available; upgrade by re-running the install steps.
